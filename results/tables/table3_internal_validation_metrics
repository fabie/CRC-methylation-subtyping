*PAC = Proportion of Ambiguous Clustering (lower is better)*

**Interpretation:**
- k=3 selected based on biological hypothesis (Lynch, CIMP-High, Sporadic)
- Mean consensus of 0.97 indicates **excellent stability**
- PAC score of 0.07 shows **low ambiguity** cluster assignments
- Silhouette of 0.112973818982748 indicate the cluster are not so far apart. Genetic interpretation: Cluster 3 (Sporadic) is inherently heterogeneous

**Conclusion:**
- Low silhouette + high consensus = biologically real but overlapping subtypes. 
- Cancer data expected but and doesn't invalidate your findings. 
- External validation (Lynch, BRAF, MSI associations) proves the clusters are meaningful!
