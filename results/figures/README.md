### Figure 5: Silouette Comparison

*Figure: Silhouette analysis using Euclidean, Manhattan, and Correlation distances. 
Clusters 1 and 2 show consistent positive scores across all metrics, 
while Cluster 3's low/negative scores reflect the known heterogeneity of sporadic CRC.*

### Figure S1: Consensus Stability

![Consensus Stability](https://github.com/fabie/CRC-methylation-subtyping/blob/main/results/figures/figS1_consensus_stability.png)

*Figure S1: Mean within-cluster consensus across k=2 to k=10. 
k=3 selected based on high stability (0.97) and biological hypothesis 
(Lynch syndrome, CIMP-High, Sporadic subtypes). 
Sharp decline after k=3 indicates overfitting at higher k values.*

*Figure S3: Methylation patterns across top 100 variable CpG probes. 
Blue = hypomethylated, Red = hypermethylated. 
Cluster 1 shows global hypomethylation (Lynch-like), 
Cluster 2 shows hypermethylation (CIMP-High), 
Cluster 3 is heterogeneous (Sporadic).*

### Figure S4: Silhouette Comparison by Distance Metric

*Figure: Mean silhouette width across three distance metrics. 
Consistent scores (0.09–0.14) demonstrate clustering robustness 
independent of distance measure choice.*
